# The Villisendo Process for Traffic Analysis
## Network analysis of traffic given the statement:
Given a connected multi-weighted directional graph G = (V, E) repre- senting a network of streets within a city (the sets of weights representing road length, speed limit and congestion as a function of time), this paper will investigate the following:
1. What is the shortest route in time between vertices a, b âˆˆ V?
2. What time should one leave in order to be on time for an appoint-
ment?
3. Atwhatthresholddoside-roadsbecomemoreviablethanmain/direct roads?
4. If the city commissioners want to add a road to the network, where should it go in order to reduce overall congestion the most?
5. On which streets should public transportation be built up to reduce congestion the most?
